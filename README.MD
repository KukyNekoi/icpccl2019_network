# Fallback Network Topology used on ICPC Chile 2019

This is a brief introduction on how fallback networking works for ICPC Chile 2019. Fallback network allows seamless connection of a "fake" gateway with direct internet access in case of the main configuration fails to perform.

You can also find this guide on my [dev blog](https://mimashita.moe/dev.html).

For this topology to work you'll need the following elements

* A 4G modem (Ehternet is optional on this one)
* TP-Link AC1750 Wireless Dual band Gigabit Router
* A switch (usually  provided by the host university)

## Why the AC1750
The AC1750 is a very (VERY) capable router, has independent 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless radios, 2 USB ports, ON/OFF killswitch, 4 LAN Gigabit Ethernet ports and 1 WAN Gigabit Ethernet port... And on top of it: Runs OpenWRT. For this tutorial we'll assume that you already have OpenWRT installed on your device, if not, [here is a guide on how to configure OpenWRT for your Archer](https://mimashita.moe/dev/home-made_timecapsule.html).

In a practical sense, any wireless router will do the trick but this one hits the spot on both price tag and capabilities.

Details of the implementation:
| Interface      | Firewall Zone | Wired ports | Wireless Ports | IP Ranges        | Protocol       | Usage                                    |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| ICPC_ADM_P3    | eth0.3        | LAN3        | ICPC_ADM_BKP   | 192.168.10.0/24  | Static Address | Administration                           |
| ICPC_BKP_PORT4 | eth0.4        | LAN4        |                | 192.168.234.0/24 | Static Address | Client-Isolated contestant network       |
| LAN            | lan           | LAN1, LAN2  | ICPC_ISO_WLAN  | 192.168.20.1     | Static Address | General Purpose wired LAN for main staff |
| WAN            | wan           | WAN         |                |                  | DHCP Client    | Wired WAN connection                     |
| WWAN_ICPC      | wan           |             | ICPC_BKP_WWAN  |                  | DHCP Client    | Wireless WAN connection                  |

## Features to be considered
### Local tunneling for LuCi and dedicated administrative VLAN port
While not mandatory, it's recommended to isolate the administrative interface for LuCi to only listed on *certain* interfaces. For those effects, the administrative interfaces will be a virtual bridged port between the Wireless Antenna `ICPC_ADM_BKP` and the `LAN4` port.

### Client Isolation
Clients connected to the `ICPC_BKP_PORT4` port must be isolated from the rest of the networks as well between themselves. This is to prevent any communication of any kind. Also, they have restricted connection to the other interfaces (more like drop all not going to WAN) and connections to the WAN are transparent via NAT, preventing for the clients to reach to the gateway directly.

### Link aggregation to 4G
In this implementation both `WAN` and `WWAN_ICPC` interfaces are WAN to the 4G network. This allows to create a redundancy to prevent shortcommings (in case of someone to trip on the cable by example).
